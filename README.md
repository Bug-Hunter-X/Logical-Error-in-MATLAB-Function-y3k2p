# MATLAB Function with Logical Error

This repository contains a MATLAB function with a logical error in its conditional statements. The function is designed to perform different calculations based on the input value, but it produces incorrect outputs for certain inputs. 

The `bug.m` file contains the function with the error. The `bugSolution.m` file contains the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and careful consideration of edge cases when developing MATLAB functions.
